# TodoMVC.NET

> TodoMVC implementations using .NET.

This project is inspired by the [TodoMVC] project. The only real difference is that this project is aimed at .NET rather than Javascript. I have deliberately tried to copy the [requirements] from the TodoMVC project so that the difference between the projects is just the language/framework.

[TodoMVC]: https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc
[requirements]: REQUIREMENTS.md

## Contributions and feedback

Both contributions and feedback are gratefully received. I have very little experience with these paradigms but I thought that sharing my effort to test them may help others as well as provide the opportunity for me to get some feedback.
